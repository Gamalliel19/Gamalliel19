<p>
I am an informatics engineering student at the Institut Teknologi PLN Jakarta who is passionate about making web and mobile applications. For now, I am focusing on iOS app development using Swift. I spent many hours writing and learning software applications and share my code through this open-source platform so you can take a look at my code. I also like to design some of my imagination apps and implement them into a real app for best practice.
</br>
</br>
Currently, I have been learning the Swift programming language for 2 months, I have also created several applications to improve my learning process.
